## Overview
  This project is an interesting one and I like the fact that I was creative to implement the basic styles needed in this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

## My process
  So basically, this project was built with with HTML, CSS(Flexbox) and Bootstrap. Before starting out, I went to the 
  READ.ME and the style-guide files to find some relevant details about the custom files needed in the cause of building this project. 
  I structured my webpage using HTML while using the 'container' Bootstrap class. The NFT preview component is designed like a card that has some details on it. The active state wasn't left out as well because that was my challenging part of this project. I proceeded to style the card by centralizing it along with the card details (images, custom icons and texts). I find it difficult styling some specific elements in my external CSS file. 

### What I learned

  First of all, I love the way the project is designed especially the dark background where the NFT preview component is centralized. At some point in the project I was finding it difficult to implement the hover(active-state) effect on the image. 

      I sorted it out while researching about it on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33986068/change-image-background-color-on-hover/33989147#33989147) 
      I appreciate the discord community that gave me a hint on how to include the SVG visibility icon with image overlay effect on hover.
